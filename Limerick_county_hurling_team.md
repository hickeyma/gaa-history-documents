# History

> Limerick\'s first outright success in hurling was achieved when the

> of the [[1897 All-Ireland Senior Hurling
> Championship]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1897_All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship)
> (SHC). At that time,
> [[counties]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(Gaelic_games))
> were represented by champion clubs.
>
> Limerick won the [[1918 All-Ireland
> SHC]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship),
> then repeated the feat in the [[1921 All-Ireland
> SHC]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1921_All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship)
> when the team won the inaugural [[Liam]{.underline} [MacCarthy
> Cup]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_MacCarthy_Cup).
> The team that achieved those wins featured many players who contested
> eight consecutive [[Munster Senior Hurling]{.underline}
> [Championship]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munster_Senior_Hurling_Championship)
> (SHC) finals (1917--1924 inclusive), a record that has never been

>
> The 1930s were the salad days of Limerick hurling, an era in which the
> county won five consecutive [[National Hurling
> League]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurling_League)
> (NHL) titles, a record still unequalled. Those titles were won in
> [[1933--34]{.underline},](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933%E2%80%9334_National_Hurling_League)
